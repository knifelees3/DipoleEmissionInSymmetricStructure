# Theory and Implementation of the Project: Dipole Near Sphere

In this project, I give [theoretical description](https://knifelees3.github.io/2020/06/20/A_En_DipoleEmissionNearSphere/) of this model. And I will also give numerical realizations by using MATLAB, Python, COMSOL,Lumerical FDTD Solutions, MEEP!

### Why I use this model?

The gold nano sphere is a very classical model in nano optics for its effect on the dipole's emission rate. The spontaneous emission rate change for two level system can be modeled by the emission power change. So it gives us a way for simulating quantum effects using classical methods.



### Why I try so many realization?

* It's out of interest.
* I want to use this model because this model has theoretical expressions and then help us verify our numerical methods. We can use this model to do numerical convergence test.
