# Dipole's emission in symmetric structure



This project is to calculate the emission properties when the dipole is put near symmetric structure.

Dipole is a very useful physical model which can be used in different fields. In my own research, dipole's emission in different media can be used to describe the properties of Atom-photon interactions in a way.  

Symmetry can be translation symmetry or rotation symmetry.

Dipole's emission in arbitrary media can't be described theoretically but when the structures have symmetries we can use some special functions to describe its properties.

I will calculate the following case:

1.   Dipole in free space.
2. Dipole near sphere.
3. Dipole in multi layered structures.
4. Dipole near waveguide.
