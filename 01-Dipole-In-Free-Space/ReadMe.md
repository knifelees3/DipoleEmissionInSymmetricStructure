# Introduction

This is to store the theoretical methods for calculating the dipole in some structures with rotation symmetry or translation symmetry.

## Dipole in free space

The dipole's emission power in free space in calculated. The formula is
$$
P_0=\frac{|p|^2\omega^4n^3}{12\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_0c^3}
$$
where $p$ is the dipole moment.
